## NDArrays, Tensors, and numbers

### 数学张量 Mathematical tensors

Mathematically, a “tensor” is the most basic object of linear algebra, a generalization of numbers, vectors, and matrices. A vector can be thought of as a 1-dimensional list of numbers; a matrix as a 2-dimensional list of numbers. A tensor simply generalizes that concept to n-dimensional lists of numbers. It is any arrangement of component numbers (or even strings or other data types) arranged in any multi-dimensional rectangular array.

从数学角度来说，一个“张量”就是线性代数最基础的对象， 一个对于数字，向量，和矩阵的概括。
